          <h2 class="start">Hello, my name is Daan Kemper app/web developer student based in the
            Netherlands.</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I develop and design apps, websites and web-apps. Coding allows me to use my creativity and
            imagination, with that i try to create new unique applications.</p>
          <h2 class="head text-start">Me</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Iam 18 years old and in the last year of my study (Media and application developer), after my
            study i would like to travel, i really want to backpack around Asia. I want to know what its
            like in country's like India, Vietnam, etc.. in Asia, just to experience the culture and the
            people in a whole different part of the world.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After next year iam probably going to sign up for an other study in a different sector, i would
            like to learn Machine Learning, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and robots because i think it is
            really interesting and it is the future.
          </p>
          <h2 class="head text-start">Web development</h2>
          <p class="text">
            During my study i create various websites as assignments, in my eyes are the assignments too
            simple for so i started multiple projects for my self to learn and to get faster and smarter in
            writing code.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In my web based projects i mainly use HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP/Python/C#. For native Android
            apps i use Java and Kotlin and soon ill begin with Swift for iPhone/iPad apps.
            I also have experience with Progressive Web Apps frameworks: Ionic and PhoneGap. Links to
            developed apps, Progressive Web Apps and websites created by me you can find on the Projects
            section of this page.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently iam creating a lot of frontend code, because i was pretty bad at designing the
            frontend. At this point i think i became a lot better in the frontend programming.
            Iam also learning Python by my self, because i see a lot of potential in python and its big
            community. The big benefit of Python is that Python is very fast and that there is a lot of
            support available for Python problems.
          </p>
          <h2 class="head text-start">Want to work with me?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I do the work. I do because I love it. I like the people I meet. I like to make the web a better
            place.

              <h1>My first big project.</h1>
              <p>
                PassKeep (web app) is the name of my first big project, the project is fully written in PHP, HTML, CSS
                and Javascript without any frameworks.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                PassKeep is a modern password manager and personal data vault. I developed and designed PassKeep alone,
                it has been in development for 2 years now and I'm still working on it.
                <br/>
                I started PassKeep in the first year of my study, I started it because I wanted to create a big project
                to learn more about programming and designing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Along the way I learned a lot more than I thought I would learn. I learned a lot about domains and dns
                records, mailing and mail security, web security, site optimization, SEO, SCSS, babel, composer and of
                course the used programming languages.

              <p>
                After working a year on the PassKeep web app I wanted to have my own app, I started working on an app
                for Android. Since PassKeep already existed, I thought it would be a good idea to create an app for
                PassKeep.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At that time I was on an internship and I was learning Java, when I finished my internship I started
                working on the app for PassKeep. Soon I found out that I needed an API for PassKeep also.
                <br/>
                I started to implement the basic features in the API and the app itself, when I finished the basic
                features
                (login, adding passwords and receiving the passwords) I released it on the Google Play Store.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The app is not yet finished, it is currently in the beta testing stage. Soon the full version of the app
                will be released.

              <h1>First internship project.</h1>
              <p>
                Voozzle is the name of the project that I worked on in my first internship period. Voozzle was only
                developed for iOS but the company wanted to target the Google platform (Android) too.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I didn't know Java at the time, I started learning the basics of Java (structure, classes, types, etc.).
                When I got the hang of Java I started working on the Voozzle Android app. By creating this app I got a
                lot of experience with Java, XML, Firebase, Google play console, Gradle and app signing.

            <div class="container">
              <h1>The follow up.</h1>
              <p>
                Fast forward a year. I was still working at the company, and the Voozzle iOS app was not working on the
                newest devices anymore. The app needed some work to support the latest devices.
                <br/>
                At that point I had never created an app for iOS. But I wanted to give it a try, the code of the app was
                already 7 years old and written in Objective-C which I never worked with.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I learned Objective-C by watching tutorials and reading articles, after a few weeks I completed the app
                and I released it on the AppStore. In those weeks I learned a lot about Objective-C, xCode, MacOS and
                AppStore Connect.

                By developing this app I've learned a lot about Android and iOS development, especially the Android app
                because it needed to be created from almost nothing.
